PGObject-Java
=============

PGObject/LedgerSMB language bindings for Java

This project provides a port of the Perl PGObject framework to Java.

The immediate priorities are:

1  Porting the PGObject system to Java, starting with the db interfaces
2  Porting the PGObject::Simple mapper
3  Porting the PseudoCSV handling
4  Porting the registry
5  Porting PGObject::Composite
